Cityscapes Image Translation using Pix2Pix GAN is a model for image-to-image translation that uses a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN). 
The Pix2Pix model is a type of conditional GAN, or cGAN, where the generation of the output image is conditional on an input, in this case, a source image.
The model's goal is to convert from one image to another by learning the mapping from an input image to an output image.
